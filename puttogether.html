        <h2><strong>What did the savior say when he first appeared among Nephites?</strong></h2>
        <div id="head">
            <p><strong>From 3 Nephi 11, We learn that:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>He declared that He is Jesus Christ.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He declared how all the prophets testified His coming.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He told that He is the light and the life of the world.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He took the sins of the world.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>He fulfilled the will of the Father .</p>
                </li>

            </ul>
              
            <p><strong>He also taught the following doctrines.(His own doctrine)</strong></p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>The importance of the priesthood to administer ordinances (3 Nephi 11:21-25)</li>
                <li> The importance of remembering our savior and our covenants by parking the sacrament. (3 Nephi 18)</li>
                <li> The importance of praying as a family to overcame temptations of Satan. (3 Nephite 18:13-19)</li>
                <li> The Savior teaches his doctrine including the first principles and ordinances of the gospel (3Nephi 11:31‚Äê41)</li>
            </ul>  
            <p><strong>Priesthood Authority </strong></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I love the following scriptures that teach us about the importance of Priesthood Authority to perform ordinances.</p>
            <p>1.And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.(Hebrews 5:4) It is telling us that everyone has to be called and be given priesthood authority by laying on of hand from authorized servant of God. Aaron god Aaronic priesthood from Moses. </p>
            <p>2. And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.(3 Nephi 11:21) This one is telling us also the importance of priesthood authority that Christ gave to his servents to baptize.</p>
            <p>In Mosiah 21:33, we read how king Limhi and many of his people were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had authority from God. And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself an unworthy servant. We understand that Ammon did not want baptize any one because he did have the proper authority to baprize.</p>

                <h2>Attributes of Christ from 3 Nephi </h2>
               <p>I believe one of the first principle Christ taught when he appeared among the Nephites is obedience. He said, " I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father." (3 Nephi 11:11) </p>
                    <li>ObedienceIt</li>
                    <li>Love
                <li>Humility </li>
                <li>Forgiveness</li>
                <li>Compassion</li>
                    <li>Submissiveness</li>

            <h3>Testimony </h3>
            <p>I know that Jesus is the Christ. He came to the world to die and to take upon himself the sins of all the human kind. He lives and loves us. I know God loves. He is the Father of our spirit. I know the prophets testify of Christ.</p>
